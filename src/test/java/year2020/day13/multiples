13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91, 104, 117, 130, 143, 156, 169, 182, 195, 208, 221, 234, 247, 260, 273, 286, 299, 312, 325, 338, 351, 364, 377, 390, 403, 416, 429, 442, 455, 468, 481, 494, 507, 520, 533, 546, 559, 572, 585, 598, 611, 624, 637
17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102, 119, 136, 153, 170, 187, 204, 221, 238, 255, 272, 289, 306, 323, 340, 357, 374, 391, 408, 425, 442, 459, 476, 493, 510, 527, 544, 561, 578, 595, 612, 629, 646, 663, 680, 697, 714, 731, 748, 765, 782, 799, 816, 833

13*17=221

5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35
7, 14, 21, 28, 35

9*13=117
7*19=119

10, then gaps of 17 numbers for 13
8, then gaps of 13 numbers for 17

119 is special
340 is special
561 is special
-102 is special

What happens if a third is introduced?
We know where we would start from

If we went backwards we would find the same pattern - which is why the steps to the first special number are nearly half


-104, -91, -78, -65, -52, -39, -26, -13, 0, 13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91, 104, 117,
-102, -85, -68, -51, -34, -17, 0, 17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102, 119,

The question is still: what would the first special number be?

The constant changes things

If the constant was 4 instead of 2 - first number is ok
If the constant was 3 instead of 2

13, 26, 39, 52, 65
17, 34, 51, 68

5*13=65
4*17=68
